* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected to see**
* **Include screenshots if applicable**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the pull request template
* Follow the coding style used throughout the project
* Include comments in your code where necessary
* Update documentation as needed
* End all files with a newline
* Write clear, descriptive commit messages

## Development Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** in your forked repository
3. **Test your changes** to ensure they work as expected
4. **Commit your changes** using clear and descriptive commit messages
5. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request
6. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review your PR and may request changes

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

## Coding Conventions
